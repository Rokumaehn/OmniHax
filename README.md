# Omni Hax

A Windows x64 memory scanner, editor, and "what accesses this address" tool.

![Architecture](docs/architecture.svg)

It can locate values in another process's virtual memory, narrow the results with
successive scans, edit the values in place, browse/disassemble the target's code,
edit that assembly, and observe which instructions read/write/execute a given
address.

> For local debugging, reverse engineering, and single-player/offline use. Running a
> debugger or injecting code into a process may be detected by anti-cheat and is
> your responsibility.

## Features

- Open a running process (optionally only those with visible windows).
- Scan **only committed, readable memory regions** for values of a selected datatype.
- Datatypes: `Byte`, `SByte`, `Word`, `Int16`, `DWord`, `Int32`, `QWord`, `Int64`,
  `Float`, `Double` (little-endian).
- Successive searches narrow the candidate addresses; at ≤ 100 candidates the results
  are shown in an editable list (editing writes to the target).
- **Access tracking** ("find out what writes/accesses/executes this address") with
  three selectable mechanisms.
- **Code browser** with disassembly (Iced), navigation/follow, and in-place assembly
  editing (shorter edits are NOP-padded; longer edits are moved to a code cave with a
  jump trampoline).
- Diagnostics pane and a set of probes for troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 x64.
- .NET SDK 10 (`net10.0-windows`).
- Administrator rights (the app manifest requests elevation; needed to open/write
  other processes).
- NuGet package `Iced` 1.21.0 (restored automatically).

## Build & run

```powershell
dotnet build
# run (will prompt for elevation because of app.manifest)
.\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\OmniHax.exe
```

If the environment blocks the unsigned apphost, run via the SDK host instead:

```powershell
dotnet .\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\OmniHax.dll
```

### Smart App Control / WDAC

On machines with **Smart App Control** (or WDAC application control) enforced,
unsigned locally-built binaries are blocked with
`0x800711C7 "Application Control policy has blocked this file"` — even through the
`dotnet` host. There is no per-app override; such a machine cannot run this app until
the policy is turned off. Use an unmanaged machine/VM if you cannot change it.

## Usage

### Scanning

1. **Open Process…** → pick a process (tick "Only processes with visible windows" to
   filter).
2. Choose a **Type**, enter a **Value**, press **Search** (or Enter). Optionally tick
   **Writable only** to scan just writable regions and **Size-aligned** to only match
   addresses aligned to the datatype size.
3. Change the value in the target and search again to narrow the candidate set.
4. When ≤ 100 candidates remain they are listed; edit a **Value** cell to write it to
   the target. **Reset Search** clears the state and re-enables the type control.

Direct searches scan in 4 MB chunks across the **Options → Scan threads** workers, keep
matches as per-chunk bitmaps (no address list), and match values with SIMD when
**Size-aligned** is on.

### Unknown-value search

If you don't know the value yet, leave the **Value** box empty and press **Search**:
this snapshots every candidate in the process instead of matching a pattern. Then
change the value in the target and press:

- **`<`** keep addresses whose value decreased,
- **`>`** keep addresses whose value increased,
- **`=`** keep addresses whose value is unchanged.

Each press compares against the previous snapshot and updates it, so repeated presses
narrow the list. The scan keeps a byte-for-byte snapshot of the scanned regions (two
buffers per region, so roughly twice the scanned size) and runs the comparison
multithreaded with SIMD; change the worker count under **Options → Scan threads**.
Regions with no surviving candidates are released after each pass. The **Writable only**
and **Size-aligned** options (which also apply to direct searches) reduce how much is
scanned. Direct and unknown searches are mutually exclusive: once one has started, the
other's controls stay locked until **Reset Search**.

### Access tracking

Right-click an address in the results list. Pick a mechanism under
**Options → Access type**:

| Mechanism | How it works | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Hardware breakpoints (debugger)** | Attaches as a debugger and programs a `DR0` watch. | Default; fastest and most precise on normal targets. |
| **Page-guard (debugger)** | `PAGE_GUARD` on the watched page, handled by the debugger. Watches reads/writes, and execution (one-shot). | When debug registers are detected, but you still trust the debug port. Slower (page-granular). |
| **In-process VEH (no debugger)** | Injects a small VEH agent and arms `DR0`; no debugger is attached. | Targets that hide threads from debuggers (`ThreadHideFromDebugger`) or otherwise resist the debug port. |

Then choose **Find out what writes / accesses / executes this address**. Hits appear
in a list; double-click a hit to open it in the code browser.

> Background: `ThreadHideFromDebugger` stops a thread's exceptions from reaching a
> debugger, so debugger-based hardware/guard breakpoints silently miss (and can crash)
> such targets. A Vectored Exception Handler runs in-process and **is** still invoked,
> which is why the injected mechanism exists. It requires code injection
> (`VirtualAllocEx` + `CreateRemoteThread`), which is itself detectable.

The tracker list can **auto-stop** after a given number of distinct writers (set the
number in the bottom row).

### Codes (freeze list / scripts)

The lower half of the window is tabbed: **Results** holds the search hits, **Codes**
holds persistent entries that are re-applied while enabled.

- Right-click a result → **Register** adds a data entry (`Enabled`, `Description`,
  `Datatype`, `Address`, `Value`).
- Right-click an instruction in an access-tracking window → **Register** adds a
  **Script** entry whose default is that instruction.
- Tick **Enabled** on a data entry to overwrite the address with the value every
  *Freeze interval* (editable, default 500 ms).
- A **Script** entry's `Value` always shows `<asm>`; double-click it (or right-click →
  *Edit script...*) to edit the assembly. Enabling injects it exactly like the code
  browser (in place with NOP padding, or a code cave + jump trampoline); disabling
  writes the original bytes back and frees the cave.
- Only one entry may be active per address.
- **Remove** (button, right-click, or Delete) drops an entry and restores an applied
  script. Closing the app leaves applied scripts in place.

### Code browser

Open it from **Windows → Code browser** (or right-click an address → *Browse memory
here*). It opens at the selected result or the target's main module base; use the
**Go** box to jump to any hex/decimal address.

- Shows address, raw bytes, and disassembly (Masm syntax).
- **Go** to an address, **Back**, **Follow** a branch/call, **Refresh**.
- Edit the *Instruction* cell to change the assembly at that address:
  - assemblies that fit in the original length are written in place (NOP-padded),
  - longer edits are relocated to an allocated code cave with a jump trampoline.
- The assembler is a limited Intel-syntax parser (registers, immediates, memory
  operands with size hints, `lock`, direct branches); unsupported syntax reports an
  error.

### Diagnostics

Every tracking window has a **Diagnostics** expander (Copy / Save). The **Diagnostics**
menu has probes used during development:
attach-only, external hardware breakpoint (no debugger), external page-guard, and
three "decoy" probes (allocate/guard/DR an untouched page) to test whether a target
detects these techniques.

## Known limitations

- x64 targets only (32-bit/WOW64 is rejected).
- Hardware breakpoints: 4 slots; the tracker preserves/restores existing debug registers.
- The page-guard mechanism is page-granular and can slow a busy page. For execute watches it single-steps instructions on the page until the watched instruction runs (capped at 200,000 steps), then records the first execution and stops.
- The in-process VEH mechanism requires code injection; on a kernel anti-cheat it will
  be detected or blocked.
- The assembler supports a subset of instructions.
